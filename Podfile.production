# Production Podfile for Nimbbl iOS SDK
# This is how users should configure their Podfile when using the published SDK

# Uncomment the next line to define a global platform for your project
platform :ios, '13.0'

target 'YourAppName' do
  # Use dynamic frameworks for production SDK usage
  use_frameworks!

  # Pods for YourAppName
  # Add webview SDK for complete checkout experience (recommended)
  # The webview SDK automatically includes the core API SDK as a dependency
  pod 'nimbbl_mobile_kit_ios_webview_sdk', '~> 1.0.0'
  
  # OR use core API SDK only if you need custom implementation
  # pod 'nimbbl_mobile_kit_ios_core_api_sdk', '~> 1.0.0'

end

# Note: For production apps, you should handle code signing according to your app's requirements.
# The post_install block above is typically only needed for development/testing scenarios.
# 
# If you encounter code signing issues, you may need to add:
# post_install do |installer|
#   installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
#     target.build_configurations.each do |config|
#       config.build_settings['IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET'] = '13.0'
#     end
#   end
# end
